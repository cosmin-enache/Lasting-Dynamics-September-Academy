We use `useCallback` to maintain function references throughout component renders.

This is can by mainly used, from my understanding, to prevent wasting resources on re-creating computationally heavy functions.

This project contains a counter and a 'functionSet' which adds a reference to the 'incrementCounter' function each time the App

component is rendered. If we use `useCallback`, we should always be getting the same number of elements in the set, as the

function reference remains the same, and sets can only accept unique values.
