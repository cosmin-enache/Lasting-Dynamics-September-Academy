SPA Pros

- SPAs only need to load resources once, at load time.
- Easy to debug, especially considering the variety of plugins available (Like react component profiler)
- Caching to local storage effectively, the app can use data retrieved even while offline.
- Option to use same back-end with mobile applications

SPA Cons

- Tricky to optimize as content is updated asynchronously.
- Slow to download at first.
- Requires JavaScript to be enabled.
- More vulnerable to XSS attacks (If input sanitization is not properly done)

MPA Pros

- No restriction on the number of pages to add, easier to scale
- Better search engine optimization

MPA Cons

- No option to use same back-end with mobile apps
- Front-end and back-end development are tightly coupled
- Development can become quite complex, resulting in longer development time
